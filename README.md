# 🌐 PROGA — My Old Portfolio

A retro‑styled personal portfolio built entirely with **HTML and CSS**.  
This was my first real portfolio website, created when I was just starting to learn front‑end development.

---

## 🧠 Overview

PROGA is a static portfolio website showcasing my earliest web development experiments.  
It includes a homepage with animated text, a list of my first projects, a skills page, and a contact page.

The site focuses heavily on **CSS animations**, **hover effects**, **geometric decorations**, and a bold neon‑style aesthetic.  
Even without JavaScript, the site feels dynamic thanks to transitions, keyframes, and responsive layout rules.
